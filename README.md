Combat-Region
=============

This essential pvp protection plugin creates the ability to create regions, users may not enter when they have been tagged. It will bounce them back, and leave them a message ;). This prevents those slick runners from getting away from you, or back into a safe area. You can now enjoy killing others without the hassle of running around chasing the user, and them getting away.

REQUIRES CHEDDAR262's CombatTag & SK89Q's WorldGuard & WorldEdit!

How it works:

Combat Region makes it impossible for users to enter a specific region while tagged. This allows Owners to make spawns, without the drop-off, you can now walk right into warzone! The plugin hooks into Cheddar262's Combat Tag, Detects if the user is tagged. If the user is tagged, and the user hits the region, the user will simply bounce back! Harmless and effective.
