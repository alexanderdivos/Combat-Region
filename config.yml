# Prefix before alerts/commands. #
prefix: "&7[&cCombatRegion&7]&r"

# Allow players to be hit if tagged in combat, even in a no-pvp region?
pvpbypass: true
# If set to false, hit detection at the border of regions may be delayed!
# Working on a fix to this!

# When should CombatRegion protect a region?
##
# If TRUE, Requires:
# COMBAT TAG: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/combat-tag/
##
# TRUE = players can't enter if tagged in pvp but can enter when not tagged
# FALSE = players can't enter unless they teleport inside
pvptag: true

# Region Names? #
# The name of the WorldGuard regions you would like CombatRegion to dissallow entry into.
# Don't use regions that span the entire map... :)

  - 'wild'
  - 'pvp'

# Message to send players who try to get back in? #
